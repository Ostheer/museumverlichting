# Library
Using the rpi_ws281x library by jgarff (https://github.com/jgarff/rpi_ws281x), as it allows userspace control of the leds via SPI.

Compile the project (on the Pi) by running `scons`, and place the static library object in `lib`.

Previously I used https://github.com/jazzycamel/ws28128-rpi, but it requires access to `/dev/mem`.

# Enable SPI pins
Add the following line to `/boot/config.txt` and then reboot:
```
dtparam=spi=on
```

Potentially you need to run `sudo rpi-update` as well.

# Led strip settings
```
ws2811_t ledstring;

ledstring = {};
ledstring.freq = WS2811_TARGET_FREQ;
ledstring.dmanum = 10;
ledstring.channel[1] = {};
ledstring.channel[0] = {};
ledstring.channel[0].gpionum = 10;
ledstring.channel[0].invert = 0;
ledstring.channel[0].count = 180;
ledstring.channel[0].brightness = 255;
ledstring.channel[0].strip_type = WS2811_STRIP_RGB;
```
